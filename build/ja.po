So the Wheel has returned to the waking world, and blood will run beneath its turnings.\n"

"<i>Once there was a brother and sister who loved each other greatly. They resolved that they were one soul split into two bodies, and their greatest wish was to become one. They found the hidden isle where the Twins, the Sister-and-Witch, had arrived when they crossed the great ocean, and a sacred pool on which the moon shone only once a year. There they spoke with the Twins in dreams, and they learnt how they might become conjoined as one flesh, and immortal.\n"

Her court poet hymned his Queen and her image, and in his poem she heard the truth: that the image was greater. So she fled into the Wood, and the image ruled her domain with the poet as its consort, but it always remembered her kindly."

msgid "A Queen's realm was invaded by a great army. When she learnt that there were nine invaders for every defender, she ordered her army to surrender its swords. Night and day her smiths laboured to melt down the swords to bronze, while her generals threatened mutiny and the enemy advanced unhindered. They used the bronze to cast a Bell, but each time the Bell was rung, it cracked and had to be recast. At last on the night before the invaders reached the city, the Queen surrendered her crown to the casting. When at dawn the smiths rang the Bell, it cracked the moon like an egg and drove the sun from the sky. The invaders fled. But the Queen without a crown was no longer any queen at all."

But the crow rejected half of all those they found,  for the dowdiness of their plumage, and the dove rejected the others, for being too gaudy. At last they found a night-bird whose feathers were both the perfect white and the perfect black of the crow and of the dove. But once they had accepted him they learnt he was no bird at all - only a night-flitting moth.

But when the glitter-winged seventh of their number told them what he'd stolen, they all were shocked into silence. They fell upon him and stripped him of his wings and drove him from the sky.
